Flutter project of a Logic Circuits game

# Circuito Sinistro

Prototype of a game app developed with Flutter during a UNIVESP project (2020/1) as part of a Computer Engineering undergraduate course.

The main goal was to develop a game for the teaching of Logic Circuits, as an alternative to traditional labs, as UNIVESP is a distance-learning university.

The game concept has a haunted-mansion theme, and the user is a computer technician who have to fix some equipments in order to leave the house and get paid. The challanges are incrementally difficult, and they cover the Logic Circuit's course content.
